# lokiCheck
LokiCheck: An expanded port of quickcheck for the language Miking 

Loki is the norse god of trickery. He is known to shapeshift and put gods to the test. As programmers we are often too confident in our functions and testing them rigorously requires a fair bit of.. trickery. 

QuickCheck is a Property based testing system that LokiCheck is based on. 

LokiCheck adds PTest to Miking.
